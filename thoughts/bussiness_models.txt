AI Business Models

March 11, 2025

1. Market Players
----------------

The AI industry is currently shaped by three main categories of players. First are the major AI labs, who are investing heavily in building "frontier" models that form the foundation of the ecosystem. The primary players include OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI, with secondary participants like META, Mistral, and Chinese companies such as DeepSeek and Baidu specializing in "open" models.

The second category consists of wrapper companies, which build specialized offerings on top of these frontier models. While being a "GPT wrapper" was initially viewed negatively, this perception was misguided. These companies possess valuable domain expertise to serve specific markets that major labs cannot effectively target. They span various sectors including legal services, data analysis, AI companions, and chatbots.

Cloud providers form the third category, with interesting dynamics emerging. Google holds a unique position with both its own lab and an Anthropic partnership, while Microsoft Azure has aligned with OpenAI. Amazon's strategic position in this landscape remains to be determined.

2. Industry Trends
-----------------

The offerings from major AI labs are increasingly converging. All major players are developing or already offer reasoning models, deep research capabilities, and support for audio, image, and video generation. New frontiers are emerging in the form of "super agents" like Manus, computer-using agents (CUA), and coding agents. OpenAI's recent announcement about their new Agentic frameworks appears to be a direct response to Manus, while Anthropic has already announced their coding agents.

A notable characteristic of these offerings is their low stickiness. Most access is provided either through web interfaces or APIs. While API integration might create some lock-in for enterprise customers, most consumers and wrapper companies access these foundation models through abstractions that make switching between providers relatively straightforward, as seen with platforms like Cursor and various LLM and Agent frameworks.

3. Competitive Dynamics
----------------------

With converging offerings, competition primarily centers on performance and price. Price comparisons are straightforward, with significant variations reflecting different cost structures and market share strategies. Performance measurement is more complex, though various leaderboards exist for comparison. Wrapper companies are developing sophisticated internal evaluation tools to determine the best value propositions for their specific use cases.

The business models vary by player type. Major labs currently pursue both consumer services (subscription-based) and enterprise APIs (pay-as-you-go). However, the consumer-facing business might eventually diminish as specialized wrapper companies evolve to better serve these needs. There's potential for high-end agent services, though wrapper companies might ultimately better serve these markets as well.

4. Market Challenges
------------------

Wrapper companies face several significant challenges. They must maintain profit margins while dealing with unpredictable user demand and complex cost structures across different models. Building sticky products is particularly challenging in commodity use cases, where switching costs are low. For instance, users can easily switch between AI companion apps, but specialized tools like AI-enabled IDEs create stronger user retention.

The pricing power dynamic is particularly interesting. While serving costs for basic models are decreasing, the emergence of "thinking models" shifts costs toward inference, changing the traditional train/serve cost paradigm. Currently, major labs have limited pricing power due to intense competition, giving some advantage to popular wrapper companies. However, this balance is likely to shift toward the labs as the market matures.

5. Open Source Considerations
---------------------------

The potential for open source (or "open weight") models to disrupt this ecosystem appears limited. While some might hope to deploy their own LLaMA or similar models to control costs, these solutions generally lag behind proprietary offerings in performance. LLaMA's position relative to commercial alternatives has weakened, and even alternatives like DeepSeek, when hosted on US-based providers, don't offer significant cost advantages.

6. Market Entry
--------------

The barrier to entry varies significantly by market segment. Simple wrapper implementations have become increasingly accessible as model functionality improves, allowing small teams of 2-3 people to create viable products. However, complex applications like IDEs or specialized tools for legal or medical fields require significant additional development beyond AI integration, or specialized domain expertise and marketing capabilities.

7. Future Market Structure
------------------------

Looking ahead, the market is likely to stabilize around a specific structure. Cloud providers will operate largely in the background while maintaining profitable infrastructure services. Three to four major labs will generate revenue through API access, offering increasingly similar services with limited differentiation. The market will see a proliferation of wrapper companies using subscription models, split between commodity use cases with thin margins and specialized applications with stronger moats.

While wrapper companies will shape how users interact with AI technology, the major labs will capture a significant portion of the value chain by taking a cut from every AI interaction. Prices will continue to decrease gradually while capabilities improve, but the fundamental structure of value capture is likely to remain stable.

This ecosystem will be characterized by wrapper companies defining the user experience and use cases, while major labs and cloud providers capture the majority of the financial benefits through their essential infrastructure and model provision roles.
